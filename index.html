            <!--include image of myself?-->
            <p>
                Programming has been a huge interest for me for many years, and I'm finally learning! I'm getting the hang of HTML and CSS right now, with Javascript and more soon to follow. I want to learn as much as I can about as many coding languages as I can. I'm particularly interested in Python, and I think Lua would be cool to learn as well, but I'd love to learn anything that comes my way.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've lived in Wisconsin my whole life, but I think it would be nice to get out of the state some day. Our incredibly variable temperatures have prepared me for any climate ðŸ˜‰.
            </p>
            <p>
                My favorite things to do in my free time are playing/listening to music and getting together with my friends. In the winter I like to ski, and taking the boat out is great in the summer.
